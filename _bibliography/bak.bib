  abstract = {Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s Disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial and comorbid condition. The asymptomatic behavior in early stages of the disease is a paramount obstacle to formulate a preclinical and predictive model of AD. Not surprisingly, the AD drug approval rate is one of the lowest in the industry, an exiguous 0.4\%. The identification of risk factors, preferably obtained by the subject herself, is sorely needed given that the incidence of Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease grows exponentially with age [Ferri et al., 2005], [Ganguli and Rodriguez, 2011].During the last 7 years, researchers at Proyecto Vallecas have collected information about the project{\textquoteright}s volunteers, aged 70 or more. The Proyecto Vallecas dataset includes information about a wide range of factors including magnetic resonance imaging, genetic, demographic, socioeconomic, cognitive performance, subjective memory complaints, neuropsychiatric disorders, cardiovascular, sleep, diet, physical exercise and self assessed quality of life. The subjects in each visit were diagnosed as healthy, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia.In this study we perform Exploratory Data Analysis to summarize the main characteristics of this unique longitudinal dataset. The objective is to characterize the evolution of the collected features over time and most importantly, how their dynamics are related to cognitive decline. We show that the longitudinal dataset of Proyecto Vallecas, if conveniently exploited, holds promise to identifying either factors promoting healthy aging and risk factors related to cognitive decline.},

The core tenet of the paper is that the most important problems that natural and social science are facing today are inverse problems, and that a new approach that goes beyond optimization is necessary. The approach presented here is radical in the sense that it identifies the roots in key assumptions in economic theory such as optimal behavior and stability to provide an inverse thinking perspective to economic modeling, of use in economic and financial stability policy. The inverse problem provides a truly multidisciplinary platform where related problems from different disciplines can be studied under a common approach with comparable results.},

One of the most important scientific challenges today is the quantitative and predictive understanding of biological function. Classical mathematical and computational approaches have been enormously successful in modeling inert matter, but they may be inadequate to address inherent features of biological systems. We address the conceptual and methodological obstacles that lie in the inverse problem in biological systems modeling. We introduce a full Bayesian approach ({FBA)}, a theoretical framework to study biological function, in which probability distributions are conditional on biophysical information that physically resides in the biological system that is studied by the scientist.},

  abstract = {While it is widely recognised that, on the one hand, reductionistic approaches are inadequate to deal with the multifactorial and complex nature of health and disease, and on the other hand, a system level understanding of the normal and pathological functioning of biological systems is sorely needed; no clear procedure have been put forth about the actual implementation of such a program. In this paper we review the tools and the mode of thinking that systems biology has set forward in the last twenty years, pinpointing its key methodological and epistemic aspects, together with the technical obstacles and conceptual limitations that it is faced with. A new approach conducive to a system level understanding of biomedical systems is thus, proposed.},

	abstract = {The Escherichia coli is a bacterium that comfortingly lives in the human gut and one of the best known living organisms. The sensitivity of this cell to environmental changes is reflected in two kind of movements that can be observed in a swimming bacterium: “run” towards an attractant, for example food, and “tumbling”, in which a new direction is chosen randomly for the next “run”. This simple bimodal behavior of the E. coli constitutes in itself a paradigm of adaptation in which roboticists and cognitive psychologists have found inspiration. We present a new approach to synaptic plasticity in the nervous system by scrutinizing Escherichia coli’s motility and the signaling pathways that mediate its adaptive behavior. The formidable knowledge achieved in the last decade on bacterial chemotaxis, serve as the basis for a theory of a simple form of learning called habituation, that is applicable to biological and other systems. In this paper we try to establish a new framework that helps to explain what signals mean to the organisms, how these signals are integrated in patterns of behavior, and how they are sustained by an internal model of the world. The concepts of adaptation, synaptic plasticity and learning will be revisited within a new perspective, providing a quantitative basis for the understanding of how brains cope with a changing environment.},
