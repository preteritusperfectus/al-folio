	title = {Spatial patterns of visual cortical fast {EEG} during conditioned reflex in a rhesus monkey},
	volume = {422},

	abstract = {A preliminary assay was made of the existence of time-space coherence patterns of fast {EEG} activity in the visual cortex of a Rhesus monkey. The primary intent of the present study was to evaluate the similarities and differences in relation to the olfactory bulb, where such coherences have been described and have been demonstrated to be associated with behaviour. Segments 1.5 s in duration were recorded simultaneously without averaging from 16 to 35 subdural electrodes fixed over the left occipital lobe in an array 3.6 cm X 2.8 cm. Each segment was taken during the delivery of a visual conditioned stimulus ({CS)} and the performance of a conditioned response ({CR)} by a well-trained Rhesus monkey. The {EEGs} appeared chaotic with irregular bursts lasting 75-200 ms, resembling those in the olfactory {EEG} but with lower peak frequencies. Fourier spectra showed broad distributions of power resembling '1/f noise' with multiple peaks in the range of 20-40 Hz. Time intervals were selected where coherent activity seemed to be present at a number of electrodes. A dominant component waveform that was common to all channels was extracted by principal components analysis ({PCA)} of each segment. The distribution of the power of this component across the electrodes (the factor loadings) was used to describe the spatial pattern of the coherent cortical activity. Statistical analyses suggested that different patterns could be associated to the {CS} and the {CR}, as has been found in the olfactory system. These patterns remained stable over a 6 week recording interval. The patterns can be better discriminated, when the factor loadings of each channel are normalized to zero mean and unit variance, to discard a basic pattern of power distribution, which may reflect anatomical and electrode positioning factors that are related to behavioral information processing by the cortex. The wide spatial distribution of the common patterns found suggests that {EEG} patterns that manifest differing states of the visual cortex may also be accessible with scalp electrodes.},
